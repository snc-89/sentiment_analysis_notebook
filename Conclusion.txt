The aim of our project was to predict the ratio of likes to dislikes using the features of our YouTube data such as comment sentiment on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. The conclusion to our research question is that we cannot reliably predict the ratio of likes to dislikes. Although, we believe that with more robust data we could improve our models to a level in which we could make much more accurate predictions. One way we could improve our data would be obtaining videos with a minimum of 50,000 views. Although our conclusion is a little disappointing, this method of collecting data from YouTube and the comment sentiment analysis is extremely useful and could easily be applied in a future project with a more precise research question, such as: "The ratio of likes/dislikes with Woman guests compared to Male guests", or it could be used to examine a YouTube channel's sphere of influence.
