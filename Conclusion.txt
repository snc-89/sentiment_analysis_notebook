We have found that we cannot predict the likes/dislikes ratio with our current features. Moving forward we would be interested in engineering more features to better achieve our goal. Among these would be
- More data. With 1400 videos, we'd like to feed our algorithms more data to get a better picture of which features are important to predicting ratio.
- More features. Labelling the data as female/male, perhaps taking into account time of dat, day of the week, or the year.
- Choosing a wider variety of videos. Because we focussed on a single channel, we feel we may get stronger results with a more diverse set of videos.
- Choosing videos with a minimum of 50,000 comments. Our best performing features were the sentiment scores. We feel that our models would perform better if they had more comment data to form the sentiment scores.
- Predicting different features. We focussed on ratio for this study but had considered trying to predict the type of guest on the podcast or perhaps the gender of the guest, or political bias and such. There are many directions we could go in regards to our data set because we feel that The Joe Rogan experience is a diverse enough channel with lots of different things to analyse


In conclusion we learned that we weren't able to predict the ratio but are hopeful of different paths to take our analysis in the future.
