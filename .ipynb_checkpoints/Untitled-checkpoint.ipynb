It\\'s a trend with a specific generation. 90% of the boys want to play video games and make YouTube videos, and 90% of the girls want to be a nurse or a vet. So I guess the boys will be playing video games, and the women will repair their injured fingers. I\\'m not always this passionate. It\\'s a topic that\\'s been driving me crazy for a few years now. People claim these kids will grow out of it, except, at what age? Their 20\\'s? And then what? They go back to school and learn how to become a professional?

There\\'s damn near an entire generation of boys who want to be professional video game players out there. I guess everybody is just going to be \"entertaining\". Perhaps one day there will be no cameras to film on, or computers to post their videos with. Because nobody will be in those fields innovating and manufacturing.

Any little bit helps me understand though. The whole genre is nebulous as hell because it is dominated by Ukrainian and Russian people, who have almost no backstory (in English, anyway). James is pretty much the only guy doing this who has a backstory in English, and it makes it super fascinating to watch for me. Especially his Don't Look Down documentary, where he went to meet with Ukrainian Mustang Wanted, who is a legitimate anomaly of a human being.\\n\\nJames is seemingly the most sensible guy doing this sort of stuff, which adds to the perceived danger. You get a crazy Russian doing it, it makes sense. But a soft spoken bubbly English guy in presentable clothes doing it? It really stresses me out, haha.\\n\\nAnyway, great guest. Insane topics. Bring some more eyes to this stuff.\"}}}},\n",

I remember coming to the U.S and meeting people with Joe's sense of humor. I didn't understand it at all and would keep away from those type of people because I didn't know if they were serious or not. I'm sure he felt the same way. Anyway I think the kid is just used to a slower talk where he takes him time in having a conversation where as Joe is yappy yappy yappy ok boom next topic.

I have also seen first hand the potential dangers of his nonsense. I live next door to a gentlemen that is mentally ill and he is devoted to Alex and Infowars. I recall after Trump was elected, but was still President Elect. Alex was pushing a wild conspiracy that Obama and the CIA where going to murder Trump and Obama was going to become Emperor. Alex pushed this nutty idea for weeks and I would read the comments and it amazed me how many people where not just believing him. They where calling to arms their response. My neighbor was one of those people, he was stock piling in preparation to fight the gov when Obama became Emperor. Alot of these new era social media outrage pushers prey on peoples fears, anxieties, and anger. I feel Alex was overtly guilty of this and he is not alone. TYT is the opposite side to that coin politically, but the same careless rhetoric. Yes, free speech is our most sacred principle, but we need to be realist about the new world we live in. I dont know, this is one issue that is too big for me. It is very easy to jump up and down and champion free speech and #FREEAlexJones, but when you see first hand that your neighbor bought another rifle because Alex Jones convinced him Obama was going to become Emperor, it puts a new spin on things.',\n",

You have to think about the world in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration. I completely disagree with your argument that other dimensional aliens have never tuned into our reality. What are all the sightings of UFOs that seem to vanish in thin air? Or sort of fade in/our of reality?
