	data exploration and visualisation
		the main variables are:
			viewCount
			likeCount
			dislikeCount
			commentCount
			ratio
			ratio_bins
			class
			sentMean
			magMean
		visualise these individually with boxplots and/or histograms, maybe display their descriptive stats (min max stdev median etc)
			just like portfolio 1
		visualise these together in a pairgrid or pairplot
			just like portfolio 1 and 2
		a heatmap of the correlations between the main variables
		perhaps a heatmap of just the magnitude and sentiment stuff with each other
		visualise some key differences between the ratio_bins groups
	simple model
		our simple model will be linear regression of sentMean and ratio, logistic regression of sentMean and ratio_bins
	prediction/modelling
		apply linear regression with RFE to find the best combination of 
			use random forrest regression to see if we can improve our linear regression
			Linear Regression
			Support Vector Regression
			Decision Tress/Random Forest
			Gaussian Progresses Regression
			Ensemble Methods
			visualise the RFE
				just like portfolio 2
			determine the variables which are the most important predictors of ratio
		apply all the other classification models and find out which one or two performs the best
			just like week 10 prac
			K-Nearest Neighbor
			Naive Bayes
			Decision Trees/Random Forest
			Support Vector Machine
			Logistic Regression
		perhaps apply some unsupervised learning to find clusters in our data
		parameter analysis/parameter tuning
			tune our parameters for each model and improve performance
			gridsearchcv?
