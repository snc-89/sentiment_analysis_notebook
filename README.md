**Project Title**: Predicting Likes/Dislikes ratio on youtube videos using youtube data

This project aims to answer the question whether we can predict the ratio of likes and dislikes on youtube videos. We have chosen to analyse Joe Rogan Experience videos to answer the question. almost 1400 videos are in the dataset, with a total of 3.5million comments. The features of the dataset were obtained through the Youtube Data API. Python files used to obtain and process our data are contained in the python_files folder. Testing of our sentiment analysis is contained within the sentiment_analysis_testing notebook, and our data analysis is contained in the data project notebook. 

Our large files of the comments we collected from the youtube api aswell as the sentiment analysis json files can be found in this google drive folder:
