Mountain lions, black bears, coyotes, and yeah the deer (but there's nothing scary about a deer). It's just my every day, so perhaps I'm not the best judge, but I'm far more afraid when I take a trip to a city. Or hell, even large towns. A friend and I went to a concert in Richmond a few weeks back and I was convinced that death awaited me at every corner. Her philosophy was ""you come from a place where you could be eaten in your front yard, yet you're afraid of the city?""; mine, however, is bears and mountains aren't in it for the sport, they just want fed. Then again, what the hell do I know, I've never lived anywhere else.","It's not completely confusing to me I guess, I feel the same way in some bad areas and the results of those studies do seem counter-intuitive, which is why I remember them.","Benjamin Kemper... I don't know what it is to be honest with you. The points you're making are the same points Sam was making when she and I went to the concert. As for being raised in isolation, no I wasn't. I went to public school, we did our shopping in towns, went to the movies, sporting events. I certainly wasn't isolated. However, in any town or city surrounding my town, the number of people wouldn't exceed about 20,000 people. I believe it's just the sheer number of folks around that scares me.","You're afraid of coming into cities or large towns, in the US? I'm confused. Were you raised in isolation or far from cites? Studies show you are safer in urban areas than rural areas.","Whos watching still in 2032?","2018","This is awesome to watch.

While this Podcast was taking place I was probably waking up in my bed on a cold christmas morning in England excited for the day ahead. Going downstairs to find one of them X Rocker gaming chairs and a XBOX 360 with Halo 3, Snow outside the window falling to the floor only to pile up in my small road. Meanwhile I had childhood worries like my homework that had to be due in for my last year of Primary school (Elementary school) getting ready to shoot off to Secondary School (High School) the following year, all the while completely oblivious to the JRE Podcast and how it would come to effect my later life. Now Im here, 17 years old, nearly 9 years on, almost double the age I was when this thing started, worrying instead about my college grades and my coursework assignments.   off to University next year...

I think some of us still at the right time, hear and feel the echos of the 60s.  I know I have.  It lingers.   I feel it from time to time.  It is a sadness that is so deep, it almost seems to leap outside the bounds of sadness itself...   That damn decade seems to mimic many cycles, crashes, aging in life itself.  The cycle is in things insignificant, global and beyond.    “Strange memories on this nervous night in Las  Vegas. Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a  Main Era—the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the  middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of.
