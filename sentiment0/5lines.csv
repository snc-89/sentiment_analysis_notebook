Mountain lions, black bears, coyotes, and yeah the deer (but there's nothing scary about a deer). It's just my every day, so perhaps I'm not the best judge, but I'm far more afraid when I take a trip to a city. Or hell, even large towns. A friend and I went to a concert in Richmond a few weeks back and I was convinced that death awaited me at every corner. Her philosophy was ""you come from a place where you could be eaten in your front yard, yet you're afraid of the city?""; mine, however, is bears and mountains aren't in it for the sport, they just want fed. Then again, what the hell do I know, I've never lived anywhere else.","It's not completely confusing to me I guess, I feel the same way in some bad areas and the results of those studies do seem counter-intuitive, which is why I remember them.","Benjamin Kemper... I don't know what it is to be honest with you. The points you're making are the same points Sam was making when she and I went to the concert. As for being raised in isolation, no I wasn't. I went to public school, we did our shopping in towns, went to the movies, sporting events. I certainly wasn't isolated. However, in any town or city surrounding my town, the number of people wouldn't exceed about 20,000 people. I believe it's just the sheer number of folks around that scares me.","You're afraid of coming into cities or large towns, in the US? I'm confused. Were you raised in isolation or far from cites? Studies show you are safer in urban areas than rural areas.","Whos watching still in 2032?","2018","This is awesome to watch.

While this Podcast was taking place I was probably waking up in my bed on a cold christmas morning in England excited for the day ahead. Going downstairs to find one of them X Rocker gaming chairs and a XBOX 360 with Halo 3, Snow outside the window falling to the floor only to pile up in my small road. Meanwhile I had childhood worries like my homework that had to be due in for my last year of Primary school (Elementary school) getting ready to shoot off to Secondary School (High School) the following year, all the while completely oblivious to the JRE Podcast and how it would come to effect my later life. Now Im here, 17 years old, nearly 9 years on, almost double the age I was when this thing started, worrying instead about my college grades and my coursework assignments.   off to University next year...

I think some of us still at the right time, hear and feel the echos of the 60s.  I know I have.  It lingers.   I feel it from time to time.  It is a sadness that is so deep, it almost seems to leap outside the bounds of sadness itself...   That damn decade seems to mimic many cycles, crashes, aging in life itself.  The cycle is in things insignificant, global and beyond.    “Strange memories on this nervous night in Las  Vegas. Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a  Main Era—the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the  middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of.

In 2007 the energy consortiums got another month added to daylight savings. It originally started for businesses that relied on daylight hours, to the impediment of industries like farming.

Uhhh, no.","The only reason you're saying that is due to most people being too stupid to have something called ""discernment"".","I still like Joe, but not as much as I used to.  I think maybe he could be more responsible with some of the political subject matter he allows to be discussed on his show.  Not sure, I could be wrong.  It seems his podcast following is big enough now that he could put the effort into vetting what his guests are going to bring up.  I'm not so sure about JRE #911.  Some may argue that people ought to know what they're getting into when they listen to Alex Jones, but the bottom line is that JRE gives Jones a platform that introduces him to thousands who aren't knowledgeable about him, and I wonder if Joe should only allow confirmed stories when it comes to certain things.  The conversational atmosphere of many podcasts is critical, but I'm not so sure when it comes to certain things.  I certainly believe in the First Amendment, and Joe's right to decide for himself what to do, and not for anyone else to force him.

Then the two decades which followed where the Israeli government assigned MOSSAD to seek out & assassinate all but three members of Black September, often by shooting them with eleven bullets. Hard not to see the potential for a connection there as the groups involved introduced the symbolic aspect themselves, it is not an invention of external observers. But what exactly it is- who knows?

Redban!!!😆","Yeah but Redban is pretty stupid","Isnt it just like having a family member or a real friend that is constantly being annoying or rude or ignorant and interrupting the flow of things. People with close friends don't just sit around and accept that shit. If you consider somebody a real friend, we tell them to shut the fuck up. If we want to treat our real friends / people like some stranger in a very polite manner, your friendships must suck and be super shallow I think. There are boundaries not to be crossed and redban crosses many social boundaries. With a stranger we can just ignore it, but with someone that is being there all the time and interrupts flows and interesting subjects, and then adds nothing to the experience, and just throws shit sandwich every now and then into the conversation or flow, you have to tell them to shut up, or else you are really not respecting your own boundaries. Unless you have none which is also not very healthy.
