He is someone you could have on your podcast too due to his crazy charisma but that's up to you of course. Nate \"The Train\" Landwehr has recently been signed to the UFC after defending his Featherweight title successfully enough with M1 global to acquire a UFC contract. Luke Sanders is a Bantamweight but I am sure he could fight at Featherweight in order to face Nate Landwehr due to them both being relatively locals in the Nashville area. That would be a great selling point to fint out who is the best fighter out of Tennessee. Keep your eye on Nate Landwehr. Dude sells himself in a promo like someone out of the the WWE, but then also KOs you when you least expect it with a backflip off the top of the cage to celebrate.",

I can't do it from my country, I am no longer abroad, so the only way is to ask someone if he or she could set up the campaign for me. If you are willing to help me, please let me know, we can connect through my official facebook account. This is an honest message, not any scam, just desperate asking for help, which is not easy for me. Thank you.\n\nOr if you have any other idea or a suggestion for me, let me know. :)",

And the funniest thing is that their big cities and sky-scrappers were made on the backs of these hardworking brown people. I don’t even get why they’re so smug; I mean they get paid to literally just sit around all day and smoke sheesha in their crisp ironed thawbs while its the sweating toiling brown man that does all the real work.",

Yeah, SJW-Cancel Culture-Digging on 10 year old jokes-stuff is horrible, but honestly, you'd think someone killed his dog or something. Freedom of speech goes both ways: no-one can (or shouldn't be able to, let's not go down that rabbit hole) prevent you from saying ANYTHING. You can say whatever you want. BUT. It's also freedom of speech for people to get upset about what you said. They can and should express themselves over it, if you say it in a public forum. It's not like I can go to a children's hospital's cancer ward and go yell \"I fucking love that your children have leukemia, you fucking deserve this you fat cunts\" and not expect to get some people riled up. \n\nIf you respect your own freedom of speech, you have to express other peoples too. You can't have your cake and eat it too, that's what freedom of speech is about. You say stuff, you own up to that stuff. Even if it is a joke, you have to acknowledge the fact that not all people are going either get the joke or think it's funny. \n\nI did laugh out loud about the \"oh I thought she died\" joke about Joe's third child though. The guy has a sharp wit and delivers some real good stingers.",

It was also a movie, and the \"prince\" was so handsome, and I fell in LOVE with him.  Then, there was another story about a beautiful little orphan girl, called HEIDI, set in the mountains between Switzerland and Germany - I fell in love with THAT PLACE, their loving nature and their love of their land.  There was also a COUNT, a friend of WAGNER - a German I LOVE - but this count was 'crazy' - he built a watergrove under his castle and built a boat shaped liked a swan - and it was dark and he lit it with millions of candles - and would get in his swan-boat and sail around  down there for HOURS.  My kinda guy.!  SO - there's the PRINCE,  the COUNT, and WAGNER one one side  -  and Hitler and his millions on the other.  See where I'm going with this?",

Yang isn't suggesting that is is gone but rather it is vastly reduced in America in order to slow down land destruction.   Americans also eat a lot more overall meat since the 60's.\nhttps://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/statistics/per-capita-consumption-of-poultry-and-livestock-1965-to-estimated-2012-in-pounds/\n\n\nAmericans need to lose some weight on average.  Probably taking that from meat consumption might be a good start?  But really this is about environmental impact.   It might be an added side bonus if we could be a little more humane about raising and slaughter of animals.\n\n\nThe land used to cultivate beef isn't just grazing land but also a huge amount of additional land taken up with growing feed for pigs, cows etc.  Alex Honnold is Vegetarian and it wouldn't seem like it is costing him much?   While some people probably really need to eat animals that is probably also rarer than expected.   Likely just eggs is more than enough and really it is about cutting down on cattle.\nhttp://science.time.com/2013/12/16/the-triple-whopper-environmental-impact-of-global-meat-production/",

And on top of that, society tries by various means to push women into fields that are dominated by men; and then blames their inability to enter and compete in those fields on the phantom patriarchy and the non-existent wage gap.",

    "commentText": "I don't know how others were raised, but when I was growing up, if I told my parents something hurt my feelings they told me to stop being a baby about it and that the world doesn't give a fuck about your \"feelings\" so fuckin get over it. Why aren't people told this now? I don't understand why people who have it easier than anyone else in the history of human beings have it so fucking easy that they have to look for something to cry and bitch about so they go with their feelings are hurt by fucking everything. I mean most people in America have a home and food and a job and a car or way to get to that job and they have TVs and smartphones and video games and 24 hour grocery stores and anything you could possibly ever need available online without ever having to leave your home and they STILL bitch about fuckin everything. Dude, we don't have to storm a beach and half of us get mowed down by machine gun fire and go fight the Nazis and start at the edge of Europe and have to battle all the way to Berlin, we don't have to get drafted to go to some jungle on the other side of the planet to fight an enemy you can't even see! We don't have to do a lot of hard horrible things and almost everything is instant yet people still find something to bitch about. Why??? Why can't people just be fucking happy with what they have and if they aren't happy go out and work your ass off for what you want. If everything is given to you you won't appreciate it nearly as much. Instead people want to bitch and cry and expect others to cater to them and the problem is THEY DO!!! It's bad enough when people cry about their feelings, but it's even worse when so called guys do it. Any guy with \"feelings\" needs to pull his panties up, wipe your vag and man the fuck up. I never thought the day would come that guys were bitching and crying about hurt feelings all the time. I don't know if this is a worldwide phenomenon or just in America but it's fucking pathetic. I'm embarresed to be an American male these days because of all the whiney American men, the male feminists and guy who just have to piss and moan about anything. Who would've ever thought that just a couple generations after the Greatest Generation that guy's would be such fucking cry babies and living with their parents into the 40's. Holy shit man. Back in the 1940's, you had 14, 15 and 16 year old boys lying about their age so they could go join the fight against the Nazis. That was the last real attempt anyone has ever made at taking over the world. Hitler was literally like a James Bond villain and kids were finding ways to join the armed forces to go halfway around the world and fight these mother fuckers so that down the road guys  ould cry about their feelings and live with their parents until they're 45 years old and not have a job and mooch off their parents. Those 14 and 15 year old boys who found a way to go fight the Nazis are more of a man than a lot of guys out there today. Now, I'm not saying most guys act like bitches, because they probably don't, but you don't hear about the guys who don't cry about everything, you only hear about the ones that do and sometimes that makes it seem like more than it is, but fuck man feelings are for girls, not men. It's fucking disgusting.",

So when a women is an 8 or higher in her life, meaning looks and job and boyfriend or husband, then all the other girls around her are like fuck that bitch... but if shes a 6 or lower in her life then they all jump in and say ohhh my god sharrrronn she needs help I lovvvve her be there for herrrrr...  guys we dont give a shit, if Mark can jump the highest then hes our jumper and if Steve can clear the books the best then hes our accountant, and if John is the best at attracting chicks then hes our wing man.  I dont know but it sounds pretty spot on.",

    "commentText": "2:15:10 I spent about 2 years not doing shit. I used to take all the callous every week for about a year and a half and I worked 2 jobs and between the 2 it was 7 days a week for a long time. Then I quit the second job, quit taking everyone's weeks for callouts and got real fuckin lazy for 2 years. I sit so much at my job driving from place to place and we are at a house for an avg of 2 mins or so. Then after sitting all day I'd get home and not want to do shit even more. For 2 years this went on and on and on. After 2 years, my legs started to hurt from such a lack of use. I finally had enough and started walking laps around the shop at work during lunch. Then after a few days I'd do 10 squats per lap and it's just went on and on from there. I haven't eaten lunch at work in over a year. I can't say I was doing brutal leg workouts, but for someone who was always skinny, but never had leg muscles, every day when I was done that shit hurt. After about 6 months, I discovered Goggins and my motivation turned to a bit of drive. I started around my birthday last year on 8/13/18. Around the time I found Goggins, I also looked at myself in the mirror and was juuuust starting to gain some weight. I weighed 197. I had never been over 180 before. I could see myself starting to get fat. So, I added in upper body workouts at home. It was a slow process and wasn't super consistent in the beginning but I never stopped my leg stuff at work. I only missed 2 days in over a year now. Any day I go to work I make myself do it so if there is a holiday, vacation day or sick day, I give myself that day off only. Well, after a year of legs and 6 months of upper body, I'm down to 167 lbs and looking not too bad. Don't get me wrong, I have a long fucking way to go, but that motivation that turned to a little bit of drive is full on drive now. This is the person I am now. Starting on my birthday this year, I just turned 38 and I finally got my ass up that morning at 4 am and started running. I hate running but I am making myself do it. 4 am every day I go to work so usually 5 days a week. Then as of a few weeks ago, I started getting to work around 6 am and doing a morning leg workout and still doing my lunch routine. I actually have leg muscles for the first time in my life. My thighs look like I'm wearing football pads on the outside! My stomach is almost completely flat, I have abs again and I'm in the best shape I've ever been in. Every day I'm doing something. I do upper body at home, but since I hated leg workouts the most, that is what I put most of my focus into and it's finally paying off. Found a way to get my inner leg and calf muscles and they are starting to show too. My body hurts like a mother fucker all the time, but it's so much nicer knowing it hurts from working my ass off than from sitting on my ass getting fatter by the day. I was gonna hurt one way or the other so why not make it hurt by being productive?? I even found a stationary bike at work to add in as well. Anyone can do this. Just don't start off with some ridiculous workout or you may want to give up early. Just slowly build. Problem is it takes time. A LOT of time. You just have to jeep going and it will pay off. I have cut my 2 1/2 packs of cigarettes a day down to no more than 26 in a day and many days being at 20 or less, down from 50 a day. Small steps but they add up. The hardest part of this entire journey I've been on by far, was the first step. Once I took that first step it's been downhill from there as far as it being hard to do. It's a great feeling to know when I start the work day at 7am I'm quite probably the only one who has put in any work on themself and gotta be the only one to put THAT much work in. It's an unbelievable feeling. I used to have trouble sleeping really badly. Now, when I lay down in a few minutes or less, I'm out cold and sleep through the whole night because I'm wearing myself out. ANYONE CAN DO THIS! Yes even you!! Start small and slowly build up intensity over time. Set small goals and once you hit that set another small goal. It's so much fucking easier than I thought, I was just afraid to get started. I'm not near where I want to be, but I'm a shit load closer than I was about 13 months ago. Much fuckin closer. Go get it folks, all of you. Work your ass to death. To the point you can't hardly walk or pick up your arms. Please go get after it.",

    "commentText": "the whole hot sauce thing isn't just like o thats how they were born tho. Some of it can be like that but the more spicy food u eat, the more adept u become to it. So say u eat 1 jalapeño a day. For some ppl (probably ppl that come from families that rarely eat spicy food), that jalapeno would be pretty hot the 1st day but gradually become less & less spicy to the point where it's literally not spicy at all. For some it might take months, others it might take days. My dad is the kinda guy that eats literally like 3-4 habaneros when he eats so i came out with a love for spicy food & a kinda gift for eating it. What burns normal ppls mouths off wont faze me since i've been eating really spicy food since i was young & literally been increasing the heat since i was like 15. It's scientifically proven that its like a muscle or anything else in life, the more u do it the easier it becomes lol ive ate food that ppl thought was extremely spicy & said dude for u this is like the ghost pepper. For me its like a serrano lmao",

So hey- don’t kill the messenger. ‘That Andrew Yang guy’ isn’t trying to make people go veggie 🤦‍♀️ He’s the numbers guy, he was just presenting some facts, not his personal opinion. Facts are yeah, reducing our meat consumption is something we actually have control over, that can make a difference in the fight for climate change and our children’s future. You have a 9yo girl???! Don’t you care about her and her future? Having a few less steaks is a small sacrifice to make ... talk about white people problems. But don’t worry- it’s the black and brown people who will he affected the worst, and poor people- so maybe you and your daughter will be fine Joe. Just remember, climate change doesn’t discriminate. Even rich white people aren’t going to be safe. For the record- I’m an omnivore. I love food. And I will not restrict my diet Or ever be vegan or veggie. But it’s actually really easy to eat veggie or vegan most of the time, to favor smaller game and more sustainable animal foods, like chicken and fish. The result of making an effort to eat more fruits and veggies and less meat- is more energy and better digestion. 🤷‍♀️ It’s really a win win win all around. So, just be a good human, and eat more plants. It’s really not that hard. No one needs to be or should be eating steak every night, or even every week. Shame on you Joe, you have a daughter to worry about. She’s more important than a piece of steak for God’s sake.",

Eat whatever you want,  but since we have scientific evidence that cattle, through the emission of flatulence out their asses and burps out their mouths causes nearly 15% of the green house gases; therefore, perhaps cattle ranchers should pay a greenhouse gas tax that will probably raise the price of beef, which may have cause and affect i.e. fewer people would choose to ingest redmeat, therefore changing their dietary intakes.\nI thought you to be smarter than this Joe?",

Over the last 20 years I have fallen in love with blues, jazz, soul, reggae, funk, hip hop early 90's rap, classic rock, and rock & roll. You need to fully know and understand them all to see the big picture of the world of music. Even African music and Brazilian music and Afro-Beat. It's all connected but unless someone knows them all very well, they will never fully understand what they are missing. Most stuff that is pre 2000 is very good outside of pop music. There is so much out there that the more you learn about older music the more realize is out there that you've never even heard of.",

It's a product that has externalities and Yang discusses implementing a modest tax which is completely logical.\n\nI'm a big fan of Joe Rogan and love my red meat but am highly displeased with the misrepresentation that Rogan had of Andrew Yang.  It was also highly disrespectful how Rogan is calling him \"some guy\" and assuming he hasn't thought out his position at all.  Rogan should apologize to Yang or invite him back on his show to allow them to continue the conversation and discuss further.\n\nAs a fellow avid meat eater, I recognize there are significant environmental costs to eating red meat.  If the entire world bred cows and pigs like the US and consumed the same amount of red meat per capita, the emissions and environmental impact to the planet would be devastating.",

Back in the day it was mandatory to have a 'joke voice' or 'joking face' that identified that the act was on, otherwise you'd get your ass kicked.  Now you can do a skit and just stand there blurring (or totally ignore) the line between a real person and character acting.",

A) the black market for meat would run rampant, bigger than prohibition. B) People would change their hunting times. Animals would over populate the forest more before there would an even larger number of hunters. And more animals would probably be hunted.\n\nEdit: poaching could/would also be a bit more common. As some people would become so desperate they would kill any animal they could their hands on. Also insects could/would become more widespread, probably throughout markets along with more protein supplements.",

    "commentText": "Yang isn't going to take beef from the American consumer any more than Beto will confiscate assault weapons -- either would be illegal.  But it is a scientific fact that the meat producing industry is causing greater environmental damage to the planet than any other activity.  North Carolina pig farmers in the eastern half of the state have just about made the place unlivable -- hog waste is held in retention ponds, then sprayed on crops, and the smell makes life unbearable for neighboring homeowners.  Floods have spread the waste to rivers and lakes, polluting them to the point where they cannot support marine or avian life -- if a fish lives through it, you don't dare eat it!  No one in that part of the state can drink their well water, nor would they consider a summertime dip in a lake.  The beef industry has the same effect, just more widespread throughout the globe.",

It's all immediate information.  They don't bother to fact check it, because it's already in the past once they've processed it, and there is so much new media coming in that is 'more relevant'.\n\n\nOddly enough, it seems like as the information age has progressed, and information becomes more voluminous and immediately available, people get swamped and can't parse it.  They simply go to their preferred echo chamber to tell them what to think about this information, and it also reduces critical thinking skills in the process.",

Also a lot has changed for Andrew Yang since he was last on.  Would love to see part two <3 #Yang2020",

Anyways, Yang said that this may lead to meat producers to internalize costs of pollution which may make meat cost more, but he's also giving us 1k a month. Anyways, \"That Andrew Yang guy,\" kinda rude, you had him on your show. You  should have him on again!",

This little guy is seriously top three comics in my world. Him, Nick Mullen, and I’ll save the number-one spot for whichever superstar standup you wanna insert here for argument’s sake. But I listen to and enjoy Mark and Nick more than any other comic right now. \n\nHearing Normand on any podcast is brilliant. He doesn’t steal the show and chimes in at JUST the right moments with really brilliant one-liners, very often unexpected. Can’t wait to see Mark become the most nervous multi-millionaire the world has ever imagined. Really really hard not to just love Mark Normand.",

They set the intravenous set up so you can only press the button and it will actually give you a dose every four or more hours. To stop the risk of overdose. \nI love how Joe alters what he loves and loathes in different episodes.",

    "commentText": "Misinformation on Andrew Yang starts at 1:07:12. Here is the issue\n\n1. Andrew Yang argued we need to stop subsidizing pollution. We need to tax items that pollute based on their true pollution cost - the cost to undo/mitigate that pollution \n\n2. An example he mentioned was beef and how beef has a huge CO2 footprint compared to other foods. [my insertion: 500 cal of beef is equivalent to driving 13 miles, while 500 cal of chicken is equivalent to driving only 3.5 miles]. Andrew Yang is arguing for a tax that works just like the tax on gasoline we are all comfortable with. The more miles we drive, the more gas tax we have to pay, to fix the roads we used and the environment we polluted.\n\n3. It's not about cow farts/methane [that is a very small part of the equation]. The big thing is that chicken and even pigs are more efficient at converting their feed into meat. So if you want beef over chicken, you have to cut down more trees, to clear the land to grow the cow food. Those forests store CO2. Lots of it.\n\n4. Yang has never mentioned anything about animal rights, nor anything about the health benefits of plant-based diets. In fact, we've seen Andrew Yang eat Turkey and Chicken on TV, so he definitely isn't vegetarian. Your rant about veganism was so off-topic. It obviously has nothing to do with Yang.\n\nI think he did say that if the whole world immediately became vegetarian the climate crisis would likely be solved, based on some science quoted by the UN, but he acknowledges you can't make people be vegetarian. he definitely didn't say most of what you said he said. I bet if you had him to discuss these issues, you'd agree with most of what he has to say on the issue.",

That type of entertainer/ comedian is down right annoying to many people nowadays, myself included. Schaub might very well have lesser jokes but Normand seems like a used car salesman to me and I doubt there is any moment in his life, he isn't \"performing\". I don't trust people like that.

Eating meat IS natural but industrial large scale farming ISN'T and it's causing huge environmental impact.

Joe said some people do, i am that some person. When i was younger id grow carolina reapers in my garden, make 2 sandwiches and half 1 pepper chopped on each one, with habaneros and ghosts on the side for flavor. I could take the pain on the way in and out but the stomach pain got to be too much. Still hard to enjoy food without a lot of spice.",

It is clearly due to lost revenue because millions of people aren't smoking anymore (no cig sales, less doctor visits, no pharmaceuticals).\n\nThis needs brought to light because they will begin to ban anything they don't like for any reason.

But, here’s where you know you better just stock up on what you can instead of hoping the truth will prevail because the stupid President who knows better than anyone about ‘fake media’ and he believes it, pfft it’s a wrap my friend! Baron probably had a Juul and got caught w it and now we’re gonna pay for it because his mom supports Big T and Big P like every other corporate fuck! I didn’t think it would come to this and I don’t know why because why wouldn’t it? The days we had a voice and rights and didn’t fear government involvement is over and Big Brothers watching if you’re know George Orwell and 1984. You know there are many countries it’s illegal to vape? That was laughable to me a year ago but today it’s right around the corner here in the U.S. of A! Scary times! It’s moving fast and I don’t know how to stop it. Not sure we can do anything but hang on and be aware and don’t let your guard down I guess. Don’t give up or give in it has to get better. I have to believe it’ll get better and this is only temporary. Don’t give up your guns is all I know for sure! Look at history and when they take the guns they commit mass murders and violate you in ways you never dreamed. The struggle is real but the darkness won’t win.

He is literally (and I mean the actual definition of literally) an honest to God comedian. He went to the deep end of the pool and that's a good thing. We need people to stand on solid ground. He will not bow. Also he isn't a dick, he just doesn't pander to people who doesn't think the way he thinks. This guest is great and I'm loving this lol I'm glad you showed me someone I've never heard of. Buuuut... Owen seems to have been shoved out of the alternative media and now is just a \"cult\" scene like the rat pack(16 candles, breakfast club, St Elmo's Fire, etc) \n\nToe.. I mean Joe.. I love you, you're a good man and if you didn't shoot out a thousand years of interviewing people in one day I would say you're a good dad but you seem to be able to put out 1000000000 years in one day, work out and spend time with your kids so you found like a wormhole or just created one and said \"fuck you universe, I make my own rules\" I respect you. I'm a God fearing man and you I will admit are good. Faulty at times but who isn't 🤷‍♂️ I think there should be a \"fearful\" interview with someone like Owen. He has been cast out for literally(again the definition) NOTHING. Yes he called you out. Yes he was a dick. Buuuut... isn't that what your show is? To get to the truth and just basically talk? I know, I'm a nobody. It would be nice though and people would love to see it",

They somehow think the stories are all true which means the comic is always in the right place for hilarity at the right time.... and is always able to recap it for people in the funniest possible way. \nComics do not hide the fact that they spend MOST of their time trying to generate material and then hone it to be as funny as possible... and by the time the joke is delivered at a special there is almost no truth to it. I'm not sure why people need to believe comedy routines are somehow truthful expressions. If they were, you'd see every comic exactly once and they'd be old as fuck. There is no way to fill an hour time slot with hilarious experiences and observations more than once per lifetime that way.",

I would once go out of my to talk to strangers and meet new people. This city has subconsciously hardened me over the years, and Mark lives in NYC. I wonder if there's any correlation there.

Yang's plan is funded by tax payers. Alaska's UBI is funded by a corporation. That is entirely different. Also if everyone was so happy with life in Alaska it wouldn't statistically have the highest out of state migration in the country. Yang's plan would cost 255 billion in taxes monthly.........monthly. Which is why he never says where it will come from and don't say he does because I've read the damn policy on his website. You're a moron if you think Yang's plan is feasible.",

This is something even he openly admits and talks about. I've listened to every, single, one... of Joe's podcasts. I've heard and watched him change as a human being. As many of us do. And if there are or is a type of person I hate most, its somebody who refuses to change. They stagnate as a person. The natural world suggests change.

Even though there are literally thousands of Chinese characters in the written language, the spoken languages and dialects of that ancient and vast land are each only composed of maybe 10,000 or so total words. English and German (the first and second richest languages in terms of total number of words in the vocabulary) on the other hand, contain many times that number of total words, a fact which I suspect is unknown to Mark Normand, yet strongly supports his theory in terms of empirical data. Also, he's not saying that people outside of the English speaking world aren't funny, he's merely suggesting that the richness of the English language (along with a unique cultural history of stand-up comedy which was born in the modern Western Civilization) enhances the ability of any person with a natural sense of humor to convey it more effectively to an audience of mostly total strangers. Nuance plus knowledge goes a long way my dude.",

Which then naturally became part of the culture here.  White folks who families were transplants or were families who came from slave owner linage have no problem with looking you in the eye. As I got older I had to teach myself to have more eye contact. Only thing that throws me off is his accent. I have never heard that accent here.

This flick is seriously Muppets on Crack, it's a freaking riot. And wow, Joe Rogan, really good working into a related conversation for an interview. Around 1:45:00 Mark's body language and will for eye to eye communicating both increased and opened up throughout his tangents and peaked at the close of his points, awesome interview man!",

All Yang wanted was for meat producers to pay for the pollution they are putting in the air, and that would cause meat prices to rise.\n\nThe comments he made were in relation to the 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions that come from cows.  So his comment was we'd like to move towards eating less meat but nothing about stopping eating cows.  Yang is on record saying that the government can't force people to change their diet and that it's a bad idea to do so.  You got this one completely wrong in motivations, context, and position",

    "commentText": "u just contradicted urself over and over again Joe. not to mention that u just bought into the msm BS abt what Yang said. he was talking abt having the cattle industry paying its share of the carbon production, and with the increased price of beef, maybe ppl will choose to eat less beef eventually. he never said ppl can't eat beef. and u talk abt ethical farming. why don't we have all the ranchers raise their livestock humanely? Cuz it costs more!! Can’t have it both ways! Either u make meat products affordable by doing it inhumanly or u cater to the top of the social ladder who choose to shop at wholefood, which is the exact same as Yang suggested, increasing the price of the meat products. U talked abt how ppl love steak, ppl’s diets r structured around meat intake. Not to get into the food science of how proteins r constructed molecularly, and is it really true whether human need the proportions of meat in our modern diet or not (most Americans r consuming way more red meat than the healthy standard). To be concerned abt human’s need above the need of all other being is a very natural behavior and psychology of human, but that’s precisely the point of why we should eat less meat products! The reason is so we can preserve our society and civilization and humanity in the long run! The low cost of meat products r destroying the only habitat we know and the only one that’s suitable for our existence. With the huge growth of population of human, to supply the demand for food is a monumental task ahead of us. Brazilian rancher r burning down the Amazon rainforest to clear land for more cattle to graze. Did u know that the #1 export product of Brazil is not coffee, but cattle! They r the cheap supplier that’s making beef price affordable. But at what cost? When the Amazon rainforest is all cut down and burnt away, u may still live out the rest of ur life in relative comfort, with ac and other amenities wealthy ppl can afford. But think abt ur children and others’ children and the generations to come. They’ll be living in a more and more hostile environment that not only threatens their way of life, but their very existence. First they’ll be confined to the indoors more and more due to the extreme weather and heat, then most likely completely indoor in the man made bubble they’ll call the world. The thing here is to think long term. Would our civilization last another 20 generations?",

If you look up the definition of edgy on google, you'll learn what it truly meant at first but I guess that other side of it just clung on to it.

It was just his personality. so I guess if its related to personality then the word is fine to me, but I know what they mean.",

    "commentText": "To give a an old/new for some perspective on Michael Jackson people dont realize what kind of upbringing Michael Jackson had, and how that affected him as he grew up and had not a sexual attraction to children, but he actually over empathized and cherished the innocence of kids.\n\nMichael Jackson and his brothers were brought up under a strict Jehovah's Witness religion that NEVER CELEBRATED BIRTHDAYS,  HOLIDAYS, HALLOWEEN,  THANKSGIVING  CHRISTMAS, ETC.... \nThroughout MJs childhood his Father kept Michael away from other kids. He was home schooled and never had other kids to play with whatsoever. \nMichael was beaten by his dad if he didn't practice and do the right thing to make the band sound right.\nEven when Micheal became famous at age 6,7,8,9 he NEVER GOT TO PLAY WITH KIDS or Exchange gifts for Christmas or got gifts on birthdays.\nAnd while he was doing Ed Sullivan show at Christmas time he'd see other kids from a distance having fun and opening gifts and doing things normal kids got to do and he never got to share in those experiences. \n\nWhen he finally broke out from under his fathers strict religious upbringing  Michael's mind was like a kids mind that never grew up\n\nThis is why he built Neverland...and invited children who could never afford to go to Disneyland to come to his property that he dedicated to the enjoyment of chdren.\n\nOf course this was setting MJ up to be accused by the parents of child abuse. \nChild abuse would never cross Michael's mind because he suffered as a kid .\nPeople looked at Michaelas a weird pedophile,  when in fact Michael was a protector of kids, and allowed them to enjoy themselves without worrying about expenses, etc.\n\nMichael cherished kids and their innocence because he lost his kid identity as he grew up. He loved seeing kids enjoy themselves on rides, and he would live through their innocent experiences and seeing through their eyes all the things he missed out on as he was being abused by his dad.\n\nI dont think Michael Jackson ever made a sexual advance towards any children . He knew what it felt like to lose his innocence,  and he cherished that and would never break a kids trust like his was while he grew ip.\n\nThat's my rant...and I'm not a black person trying to defend him. I  am just relaying my truth to you for review",

He’s certainly enthusiastic about and an advocate for comedy, but his stand-up is just not very funny to me.

Joe can sit there straight faced in front of Mark for most of the time, meanwhile Joey Diaz will fell the same coke story for the 900th time and Joe will be bent over dying of laughter. He certainly likes the idea of being a comedian...",

As a guy with many personality quirks, mark normand may have gotten in his head about making a good impression to all of the avid joe rogan viewers. He’s just TRYING. What the fuck is wrong with that? Of course a scientist coming on or Bert or segura or Diaz are gunna be casual because joe already launched all of them into the next level. This is marks first shot to get some real clout. Listen to the shit he says during the interview and not just judge his surface level “too much too on” persona. He struggles to make eye contact ffs. How authentic do you think you’d come across if you were an up and coming comedian being on the biggest podcast in history? “Chilling and having a conversation” doesn’t seem so easy now, does it? Have a little empathy my man",

Most introverts make meaningful eye contact in that they really mean to when they make eye contact.  In public speaking that goes out the window of course but as an introvert myself I force that on myself.  There is an active thought process where I say to myself, \"You looked at the left side of the room, now look at the right side.  Good.  Shift your gaze to the front row, good.\" basically you want the entire room to feel like they are not left out.  You must also make constant eye contact during \"questions\" phase.

I think maybe the reason why Joe often seems less funny or less comedically conscious around other comedians might be that he is a lot more comfortable because of their mutual understanding of peership within the world of comedy, and he may just feel less inclined to react to every line because there is an already implied  reaction of “That was good” with most of the conversation. I mean, they’re friends. With a “serious” person that Joe respects on an intellectual level, he’ll crack a joke to make them more comfortable, and he’ll react to a joke because it’s “not as expected.”",

He was just talking about including carbon tax in everything not just meat and it doesn't make expensive too much to want it. Part of it will be covered by producer due to market competition and the part consumer. The tweet description did not represent the actual content of the video.\nyoutube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=j6EGQGz-MXA&t=2985\nWatch it and make up your mind yourself maybe you will agree with the caption maybe not.",

The higher up in the food chain you get the more energy is lost from one level to the next. How much energy do you think is stored in your body today? How much energy have you ate through out your life? Farm animals need to eat. The meat industry means that more land is used to grow the animals feed. It uses much more land than if we just ate plants directly. So now you are killing the animals you are eating and the animals the die clearing the land the feed is grown on, which is more than the land need for full veg diet. I don't care that much about Joe's opinion on this issue but I do care that he is potentially misinforming millions of ppl when it would take him one second of though to realize he is wrong.",

Someone else pointed out he has daughters that age. That joke hits differently to a dad of teenage girls than a guy like Mark who has no kids. Maybe he just didn’t find it that funny.

I don't think this guy has an offstage personality. In Fact, he might very well agree with that statement.
